    <p>For each currency we have generated a new address. Any money sent to this 
    address will be deposited to your account. Please note, that we wait until we 
    get at least <strong>[% currency.minconf %]</strong> confirmation of the 
    transaction, so it will take some time for sent money to appear here. This 
    delay depends on network size and load at this moment.</p>

    <p><strong>You need to come back to this page when you will see confirmations of your
    transaction in order to finalize deposit. Site will check your balance only during
