    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions:</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>My controls at the table disappeared or table "froze"! What should I do?!!</strong></p>
        <p>This happens when connection to our server was lost for a short moment and 
        software were not able to recognize it. We are working on polishing this part.
        In the mean time if this happens to you - press F5 button in table window.</p>

      <li>
        <p><strong>Where is my deposit?</strong></p>
        <p>Bitcoin network uses "confirmations". Right now we accept transactions with 
        just single confirmation. Your bitcoin client should show you number of received 
        confirmations. If you used other ways to send bitcoins you can use 
        <a href="http://blockexplorer.com" target="_blank">Block Explorer</a> to look
        for information about your transaction.</p>

      <li>
        <p><strong>When my withdrawal will be processed?</strong></p>
        <p>For security reasons we keep very limited number of bitcoins on server, 
        therefore not all transactions are processed automatically. When server balance 
        below amount you are trying to withdraw transaction queued for manual processing. 
        We usually process transactions within 24 hours. Please use form on the right if 
        you did not receive your withdrawal after 24 hours.</p>

        <p>1 chip = 0.01 bitcoin. This means you will get 100 chips for your 1 bitcoin.</p>
